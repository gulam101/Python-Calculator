# Python-Calculator

## I created a calculator using Python in college - Python 2.7 IDE

### Description:

This was a project I designed in college. I had to put everything I learnt with Python and create a project that would do something. My choice of project was a calculator that allowed the user to pick any option and simply do their calculations. 

### Instructions:

When the user clicks on the project, whey will be greeted with an application that will ask them to input a number based on the choice they want. (All choices are labelled)

### What I learnt:
- Better understanding of Python

### Improvements:
- Better interface
